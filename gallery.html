                        <p>Various activities and events I participated in during my time at UiTM Merbok, such as futsal tournaments, cultural nights, motivational talks, and outdoor programs, played a huge role in shaping my personal and social development. These moments helped me build strong friendships, improve my teamwork skills, and discover new passions outside the classroom. It was during these times that I truly experienced the spirit of campus life and created lasting memories with peers who shared similar goals and ambitions.

                        <p>Working with classmates on various group assignments and projects taught me the importance of communication, leadership, and mutual respect. Whether it was preparing presentations, brainstorming for ideas, or overcoming challenges together, each collaboration gave me a chance to grow and learn from others. These group efforts not only improved my academic performance but also strengthened my interpersonal skills, preparing me for real-world teamwork in future career settings. Iâ€™m truly grateful for the friendships and teamwork spirit built during these moments.

                        <p>Moments from study sessions, library time, and exam preparations reflect the effort and discipline I invested in my academic journey.
